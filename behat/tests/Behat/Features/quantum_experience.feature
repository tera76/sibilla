  Scenario: Add a variable with distribution and phase parameters
    Given I have the q-variable 'andrea'

  # equal to "andrea" should be "1"
  #  And the distibution of 'andrea' states is:
 #     | key | value |
  #    | -1  | 33    |
  #    | 0   | 33    |
  #    | 1   | 33    |
  #  And the phase of 'andrea' states is: 45
